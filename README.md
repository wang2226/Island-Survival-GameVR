# **Survival Game VR**
## Description

You are lost on an island in a storm. Your health decreases as time goes on. You need to find the helicopter to escape before you die. You have a rifle and can shoot anything that gets in the way. The only light source is above your head and follows when you move your head. There is a charging station with a light tower where you can restore to full health. However, there is a fake one that looks similar. Be careful with the zombies! There are two zombies and if you run into them, you will die instantly.
